<h1>Help for petals around the rose</h1>

<p>
This is a variation of an old dice game.  I'll throw five dice, then
ask you "How many petals around the rose?"  Type a number into the
text box, and press the submit button.  The answer is related to the
die rolls.  There really is a pattern.
</p>

<h2>Hints:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The name of the game is really important</li>
    <li>Most people think way too hard</li>
    <li>Use the "back" button to look back over your guesses</li>
    <li>Did I mention the name means something?</li>
  </ul>
